# odin-recipes
A project by The Odin Project Foundations Course

The website consists of a main index page which has links to two of my favorite recipes.

Review of what I have learned:

- Setting up basics HTML is quite fast with the boilerplate.
- Thinking about when to make a commit and how to write them in a logical way.
- When I reviewed the end result I saw that I missed the text of the links. This bug made me realize that reviewing/testing is important.
